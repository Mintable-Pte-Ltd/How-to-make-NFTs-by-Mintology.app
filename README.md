---

# Preminting NFTs

Pre-minting is the process of preparing NFT metadata and assets, before the actual on-chain minting happens.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that your users will not be able to mint or claim more items than what you have preminted. You can add more items anytime, even after the project has been deployed.

## Why Premint?

There are several benefits to preminting NFTs:

- It allows you to prepare and organize all the NFT metadata ahead of time. This includes properties like name, description, image, attributes etc.
- The preminted metadata can be reviewed and validated before minting. This prevents errors in the actual on-chain NFT data.
- It separates the metadata preparation from the blockchain minting. The metadata can be prepared offline and uploaded in bulk.
- Pre-minting enables features like white-listing and pre-sale for NFT drops by assigning slots to users before minting.
- It provides more flexibility in the actual on-chain minting process. The metadata can be uploaded in batches based on priorities.

## How Pre-Minting Works

The preminting process typically involves uploading NFT metadata like name, description, images to Mintology: this can be done using the [Mintology web app](https://dashboard.mintology.app), or the API. When ready to mint, the preminted metadata is retrieved and used to mint NFTs on-chain.

## How to use the API

### NFT Metadata

Please note that the metadata will either need to be self-hosted or you can create or add it via the platform and we will store the metadata on our end. The NFT metadata includes name, image url, animation url (optional), description (optional), other attributes (optional).

**Note**: We also offer a 10 year guarantee for data hosted on our server.

### Preminting NFT

You can find the API documentation under **[Premints](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/premints)**.

Here's how you can create a premint NFT:

#### Endpoint:

- **URL**: `https://api.mintology.dev/{projectId}/premints`
- **Method**: `POST`

#### Path Parameters:

- `projectId` (required, string): The Project ID from your Mintology dashboard.

#### Body Parameters:

- `premint_id` (optional, string): Creates a new preminted NFT data set.
- `quantity` (required, number): Specifies the number of NFTs to create with this data set.
- `metadata` (required, object): The metadata for the NFT pre-mint data.

##### Metadata Object:

- `name` (required, string): Name of the item.
- `image` (required, string): URL to the image of the item. Supports various image types, including SVG.
- `animation_url` (optional, string): URL to a multimedia attachment for the item. Supported file extensions include GLTF, GLB, WEBM, MP4, M4V, OGV, OGG, MP3, WAV, and OGA. HTML pages are also supported for rich experiences and interactive NFTs.
- `description` (optional, string): A human-readable description of the item. Markdown is supported.
- `attributes` (optional, array of objects): Attributes for the item, displayed on the item page on Mintology and other marketplaces.
- `title` (optional, string): Title of the NFT, used for listing the item for sales.
- `subtitle` (optional, string): Short description or subtitle of the NFT, used for listing the item for sales.

#### Example Request (Node.js):

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function createPremint() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/premints",
    {
      quantity: 10,
      metadata: {
        name: "Exclusive Artwork",
        image: "https://example.com/image.png",
        description: "Limited edition digital artwork",
        title: "Exclusive Artwork",
        subtitle: "Limited edition digital artwork by renowned artist",
      },
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "Api-Key": "Your API Key",
      },
    }
  );

  console.log(response.data);
}

createPremint();
```

You can either create items one by one, using the **[Create](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/premints-create)** endpoint above, or in bulk, using the **[Import](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/premints-import)** endpoint. The latter allows you to use a file (JSON or CSV) with all the details, or send all the parameters when you call the endpoint.

Once you have created (or imported) all the required premints, you can enable minting on your project. When your users mint or claim one of your NFTs, a random item among the premints will be selected.

Let us know if you have any other questions!

# Mintable Wallets

Once you have preminted NFTs, you would need to create wallets for your users to store the NFTs. Mintology provides a way to create custodial wallets, where users can later claim custody of their private keys. This process also creates a Mintable account for the users.

## What are Mintable Wallets

### The Issue

A crypto wallet is basically at its core is a set of keys (private keys, to be precise) that need to be kept ultra-secret and are used to sign messages. There are lots of noncustodial wallets (like Metamask, Coinbase, and more) out there, but they demand your users to be crypto-savvy and take the whole responsibility of keeping their private key or seed under wraps.

### Mintology's solution

Mintology allows you to offer custodial wallets to your users. No crypto jargon, no extra knowledge needed, it's just like having an extra account. They can stick to their fave login methods (Google, Apple, you name it) and they‚Äôre good to go.

### The User‚Äôs Journey

Some users might get curious and want to dive deeper, deciding to take charge of their assets by themselves. They can do this right from their profile page on [Mintable](https://mintable.com), but you can control the entire process from your own website using the Mintology API. Designed with security at its core, the API ensures your users have truly taken control of their key before it gets deleted from our system.

## How to use the APIs

**IMPORTANT**: Before you start using the APIs, make sure that you have enabled Mintable Wallets on your Settings page on [Mintology web app](https://dashboard.mintology.app)

Below are the steps to create a custodial wallet:

#### Endpoint:

- **URL**:`https://api.mintology.app/v1/custodial-wallets`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Important**: Make this call from the back-end.

#### Body Parameters:

- `email` (required, string): The email address of the user for whom the wallet is being created.

- `username` (optional, string): The username associated with a Mintable.com account. If omitted, a random username will be generated, which the user can later change on Mintable.com.

#### Example Request (Node.js):

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function createWallet() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://api.mintology.app/v1/custodial-wallets",
    {
      email: "user@example.com",
      username: "user123", // Optional
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "Api-Key": "Your API Key",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

createWallet();
```

#### Response:

Upon a successful wallet creation, a response will be received with the following data:

- `email` (string): The email address tied to the wallet.

- `username` (string): The username tied to this wallet, generated randomly if not provided.

- `wallet_address` (string): The created wallet address.

With the wallet created, you can now proceed to either mint or claim NFTs into these wallets.

## Helping a User to take custody of their wallet

If you choose to let your users take control of their key from your website, here‚Äôs the path to follow:

1. Kickstart the private key claim process with the **[Request To Export](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/custodial-wallets-exports-request)** endpoint: Doing this sends an email from Mintable to the user with an OTP. This OTP is our safety check to ensure your user genuinely wants to take control of their key.

2. Get the user to share the OTP received from Mintable, and pass it to the **[Approve Export](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/custodial-wallets-exports-approve)** endpoint.

3. Hand over the key to your user, making sure they grasp the big deal of taking control and have jotted down their key somewhere safe. **Remember, it's crucial to spell this out to them clearly, and this is your responsibility!**

4. Ask Mintology to erase the private key from Mintable's database through **[Remove Mintable Wallets](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/custodial-wallets-remove)** endpoint.

## A Peek into Encryption Technicalities üîê

To amp up the security, we‚Äôll hand you an encrypted private key. You‚Äôll need to decrypt it before showing it to the user. Your decryption process will need your Mintology API Key (a secret you already know) and the `encrypt_iv` parameter (a fresh secret), which is returned to you by the _Approve Export_ endpoint. Here's a little code snippet to show you how to decrypt the key.

```ts
const { createDecipheriv } = require("crypto");

const IV_INPUT = "YOUR_IV";

const PRIVATEKEY_INPUT = "ENCRYPTED_PRIVATE_KEY";

const ENCRYPTION_SECRET_INPUT = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const iv = Buffer.from(IV_INPUT);

const encryptedText = Buffer.from(PRIVATEKEY_INPUT);

const encryptionSecret = Buffer.from(ENCRYPTION_SECRET_INPUT);

const decipher = createDecipheriv("aes-256-cbc", encryptionSecret, iv);

let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedText);

decrypted = Buffer.concat([decrypted, decipher.final()]);

console.log("decrypted private key", decrypted.toString());
```

To tie up loose ends, you‚Äôll need to provide a SHA256 hash (a variant of SHA-2) of the last 8 characters of the private key. This ensures that if you goof up the decryption, the key won't be deleted from the Mintable database by mistake.

Letting a user claim custody of their wallet is a bit complex, do reach out to [Mintology support](https://dashboard.mintology.app/contact-us) anytime!

# Minting and Claiming NFTs

**IMPORTANT**: Before you start using the APIs, make sure that you have deployed your project and enabled Claiming and Minting through the **[Claim Config Update](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/projects-claim-update)** and **[Mint Config Update](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/projects-mint-update)** endpoints or through your Project Dashboard page on [Mintology web app](https://dashboard.mintology.app).

Once the wallets are set up for your users, you can proceed to mint or claim NFTs into these wallets.

## How Minting and Claiming Works

### Mint

Use the **[Mint](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/mint)** endpoint to mint the NFT, including metadata as an object in the request body.
This API endpoint is designed for minting NFTs straight into a user's wallet. Ideal for selling NFTs, targeted airdrops, or minting collectibles. Supports both custom Mintable Wallets and standard crypto wallets.

### Claim

Use the **[Claim](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/claim)** endpoint to mint a free NFT to your user's wallet (which can be a Mintable Wallet, or their existing crypto wallet). This is the endpoint you should use for discount coupons, proof of attendance, and in general NFTs which you do not intend to sell.

Note: Keeping 'mint' and 'claim' endpoints separate simplifies analytics, making it easier to track each call's specific purpose.

## How to use the API

Note: If you don't pass in a metadata object - it will create a random NFT using your pre-mint data you've set up through the API endpoints or dashboard. But if you pass in a metadata object, it will mint a new NFT with the new metadata object you passed in.

### Minting NFTs

Minting is ideal for selling NFTs, targeted airdrops, or minting collectibles. You can mint NFTs directly into a user's wallet using the following endpoint:

#### Endpoint:

- **URL**: `https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/mint`
- **Method**: `POST`

#### Path Parameters:

- `projectId` (string, required): Your project ID found on your dashboard.

#### Body Parameters:

- `metadata` (object, optional): If absent, the metadata defined in the project will be used. Otherwise, it will mint a new NFT with the new metadata object you passed in.
  - `name` (string, required): Name of the item.
  - `image` (string, required): URL to the image of the item (350 x 350 recommended).
  - `animation_url` (string, optional): URL to a multimedia attachment for the item.
  - `description` (string, optional): A human-readable description of the item (Markdown supported).
  - `attributes` (array of objects, optional): Attributes for the item.
  - `title` (optional, string): Title of the NFT, used for listing the item for sales.
  - `subtitle` (optional, string): Short description or subtitle of the NFT, used for listing the item for sales.
- `wallet_address` (string, required): Wallet address to mint the token to.

#### Example Request:

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/mint   -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"   -d '{
    "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    "wallet_address": "WALLET_ADDRESS",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "NFT_NAME",
      "description": "NFT_DESCRIPTION",
      "image": "IMAGE_URL",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "trait_type": "color",
          "value": "blue"
        }
      ],
      ....
    }
  }'
```

#### Example Request (Node.js):

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function mintNFT() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/mint",
    {
      metadata: {
        name: "Unique NFT",
        image: "https://example.com/image.png",
      },
      wallet_address: "0x12345...",
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "Api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

mintNFT();
```

After minting, check the event logs to confirm the NFT's status on the Mintology dashboard.

### Claiming NFTs

Claiming is ideal for discount coupons, proof of attendance, or NFTs which you do not intend to sell. You can claim NFTs using the following endpoint:

```plaintext
POST https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/claim
```

This endpoint will mint a free NFT to your user's wallet, which can be a Mintable Wallet or their existing crypto wallet. The mint and claim endpoints are kept separate to simplify analytics and track each call's specific purpose.

#### Path Parameters:

- `projectId` (string, required): Your project ID found on your dashboard.

#### Body Parameters:

- `wallet_address` (string, required): Wallet address to mint the token to.

#### Example Request (Node.js):

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function claimNFT() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/claim",
    {
      wallet_address: "0x12345...",
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "Api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

claimNFT();
```

After claiming, check the event logs to confirm the NFT's status on the Mintology dashboard.

# Token Gating

**IMPORTANT:** Before you start using the APIs for Token Gating, make sure that you have a Wallet ready with the token to test it out, if not follow the flow mentioned at the end of [Quickstart](https://docs.mintology.app/docs/3_quickstart)

## How Token Gating Works

Using these APIs, developers can restrict access to specific content, ensuring only those with a particular NFT can view it. This functionality can be leveraged for exclusive content, premium experiences, and more.

## How to use the API

In order to demonstrate authorization based on NFT ownership and grant access accordingly, we'll be utilizing the Authorize endpoint. This endpoint validates token ownership using the Mintology API Key and Project ID. The guide will walk through a scenario where a developer needs to check if a certain email address has been minted a specific NFT, and if so, grant access to a special page, product, or discount.

## Authorization Based on NFT Ownership

### Step 1: Set up the Authorization Check

Firstly, you'll need to make a request to the Authorize endpoint to check for NFT ownership based on the user's email address.

#### Endpoint:

- **URL**: `https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/authorize`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Important**: Make this call from the back-end.

#### Path Parameters:

- `projectId` (string, required): Your project ID found on your dashboard.

#### Body Parameters:

- `walletAddress` (string, required): The walletAddress of the user you want to check NFT ownership for.
- `token_id` (string, optional): This is the token id of the specific NFT token within the contract and it is optional; if absent, any token in the contract will authorize the wallet.

#### Example Request (Node.js):

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function checkNFTOwnership() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    "https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/authorize",
    {
      walletAddress: "walletAddress",
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "Api-Key": "Your API Key",
      },
    }
  );
  return response.data;
}

checkNFTOwnership();
```

### Step 2: Grant Access Based on Authorization Result

The response from the Authorize endpoint will tell you if the specified email address has a specific NFT. Based on the response, you can then program your application to grant or deny access to the special page, product, or discount.

```javascript
async function grantAccess() {
  const ownershipData = await checkNFTOwnership();

  if (ownershipData.authorized) {
    // User has the NFT, grant access
    console.log("Access granted");
    // Redirect to special page, grant discount, etc.
  } else {
    // User does not have the NFT, deny access
    console.log("Access denied");
    // Redirect to a different page, show an error message, etc.
  }
}

grantAccess();
```

### Alternatives

You can also use the **[List Authorised Tokens](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/authorize-inventory)** endpoint to get the list of tokens that a user owns from a particular collection and control what is accessible for the user through that information.

# Immutable X Integration

## What is IMX?

Immutable X (IMX) is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aimed at reducing the environmental impact of NFT transactions while ensuring instant trade confirmation, massive scalability, and no gas fees without compromising user custody. Integration with Immutable X can significantly enhance the user experience by making transactions faster and more cost-effective.

## How to use the API

You can find the API documentation under **[IMX](https://docs.mintology.app/reference/imx)**.

The integration involves registering an IMX user, minting, and transferring IMX items. Below are the steps to achieve this integration:

### Step 1: Register IMX User

Registering a user on Immutable X is the initial step for IMX integration. This is done through the `Register IMX User` endpoint.

#### Endpoint:

- **URL**: `https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/imx/register`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Important**: Make this call from the back-end.

#### Path Parameters:

- `projectId` (string, required): Your project ID found on your dashboard.

#### Body Parameters:

- `email` (string, required): The email of the user you want to register for.
- `username` (string, optional): The username that will be tied to this private key/wallet.

#### Example:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function registerIMXUser() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/imx/register',
    {
      username: 'optionalUsername', // Optional username
      email: 'user@example.com', // replace with the user's email
    },

    {
      headers: {
        'Api-Key': 'Your API Key',
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

registerIMXUser();
```

### Step 2: Mint IMX Item

Once the user is registered on IMX, the next step is to mint an IMX item using the `Mint IMX Item` endpoint.

#### Example:

```javascript
async function mintIMXItem() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/imx/mint',
    {
      metadata: {
        // Add other metadata properties as needed
      },
      token_id: 'uniqueTokenId', // Token id of the NFT being minted
      wallet_address: 'walletAddress', // The wallet address of the user minting the NFT
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'Api-Key': 'Your API Key',
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

mintIMXItem();
```

### Step 3: Transfer IMX Item

The final step in IMX integration is transferring the minted IMX item to another user using the Transfer IMX Item endpoint.

#### Example:

```javascript
async function transferIMXItem() {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.mintology.app/v1/{projectId}/imx/transfer',
    {
      from_wallet_address: 'fromWalletAddress', // The wallet address owns the token at the contract address
      to_wallet_address: 'toWalletAddress', // The recipient of the token
      token_id: 'uniqueTokenId', // The token id to transfer, must exist and belong to from_wallet_address
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'Api-Key': 'Your API Key',
      },
    }
  );
  console.log(response.data);
}

transferIMXItem();
```
